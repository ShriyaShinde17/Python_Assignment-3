This project contains two Python programs:

1.Factorial of a Number:
A function named factorial is defined.
Inside the function, a variable fact is initialized with 1.
A for loop runs from 1 to num.
In each step, the current value of i is multiplied with fact.
Finally, the factorial value is returned.
The user is asked to enter a number.
The factorial function is called with that number.
The result is displayed on the screen.


2.Mathematical Calculations using the math Module:
The math module is imported so we can use mathematical functions.
The user is asked to enter a number.
It is converted to float because math functions work with decimal values too.
math.sqrt(num) → calculates the square root.
math.log(num) → calculates the natural logarithm (base e).
math.sin(num) → calculates the sine of the number (in radians).
